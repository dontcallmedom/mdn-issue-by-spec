The spec says otherwise, it inherits from EventTarget. A ServiceWorker <strong>is not</strong> a Worker. Messages arrive at the ServiceWorkerGlobalScope, not the ServiceWorker itself. Yes, it's strange, but that's what the spec says.</p>\n<h4>Specific section or headline?</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Properties<br>\nThe ServiceWorker interface inherits properties from its parent, Worker.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>The error isn't obvious, because Worker has no own properties and inherits them from EventTarget, but Worker is still not the parent</em></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Methods<br>\nThe ServiceWorker interface inherits methods from its parent, Worker, with the exception of Worker.terminate</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>As far as I know, selective inheritance is not a thing in IDL or JavaScript</em></li>\n<li><em>Yes, Worker has a postMessage and a terminate method, and ServiceWorker has a postMessage method. But no, ServiceWorker doesn't inherit it. The procedures in the HTML and ServiceWorker specs are similar, but not identical.</em></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>What did you expect to see?</h4>\n<p>A description that conforms to the spec. But I'm not familiar enough with the topic to rewrite this.</p>\n<h4>Did you test this? If so, how?</h4>\n<p>I checked the prototype chain in Chrome DevTools. It's ServiceWorker -&gt; EventTarget</p>\n\n<details>\n<summary>MDN Content page report details</summary>\n<ul>\n<li>Folder: <code>en-us/web/api/serviceworker</code></li>\n<li>MDN URL: <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/ServiceWorker\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/ServiceWorker</a></li>\n<li>GitHub URL: <a href=\"https://github.com/mdn/content/blob/main/files/en-us/web/api/serviceworker/index.html\">https://github.com/mdn/content/blob/main/files/en-us/web/api/serviceworker/index.html</a></li>\n<li>Last commit: <a class=\"commit-link\" data-hovercard-type=\"commit\" data-hovercard-url=\"https://github.com/mdn/content/commit/642d6eb7feb73e17cfc1ef61d3d09c2d200e65ca/hovercard\" href=\"https://github.com/mdn/content/commit/642d6eb7feb73e17cfc1ef61d3d09c2d200e65ca\"><tt>642d6eb</tt></a></li>\n<li>Document last modified: 2021-06-17T03:52:55.000Z</li>\n</ul>\n</details>",

It turns out that it at least causes a network request for the worker, and that request doesn't go via the cache even if you have <code>updateViaCache: 'all'</code> (which makes sense). So regardless of your update mode, not checking for an existing registration will cause extra server load.</p>\n<h4>Specific section or headline?</h4>\n<blockquote>\n<p>You can call this method unconditionally from the controlled page. I.e., you don't need to first check whether there's an active registration.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h4>What did you expect to see?</h4>\n<p>More detailed info about why I might <em>want</em> to check for an existing registration, even if I don't <em>need</em> to.</p>\n<h4>Did you test this? If so, how?</h4>\n<p>Yes, looking at request headers in Fiddler.</p>\n\n<details>\n<summary>MDN Content page report details</summary>\n<ul>\n<li>Folder: <code>en-us/web/api/serviceworkercontainer/register</code></li>\n<li>MDN URL: <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/ServiceWorkerContainer/register\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/ServiceWorkerContainer/register</a></li>\n<li>GitHub URL: <a href=\"https://github.com/mdn/content/blob/main/files/en-us/web/api/serviceworkercontainer/register/index.html\">https://github.com/mdn/content/blob/main/files/en-us/web/api/serviceworkercontainer/register/index.html</a></li>\n<li>Last commit: <a class=\"commit-link\" data-hovercard-type=\"commit\" data-hovercard-url=\"https://github.com/mdn/content/commit/642d6eb7feb73e17cfc1ef61d3d09c2d200e65ca/hovercard\" href=\"https://github.com/mdn/content/commit/642d6eb7feb73e17cfc1ef61d3d09c2d200e65ca\"><tt>642d6eb</tt></a></li>\n<li>Document last modified: 2021-06-17T03:52:55.000Z</li>\n</ul>\n</details>",
