But for a site providing \"documentation\" I think it would be good to mention in what order the touches are in <code class=\"notranslate\">TouchEvent.touches</code> - is it just random? Is it in the order of which touch last changed? Or is it in the order they actually were added? It makes it easier to make safe assumptions to write robust code.</p>\n<h3 dir=\"auto\">Do you have any supporting links, references, or citations?</h3>\n<p dir=\"auto\"><em>No response</em></p>\n<h3 dir=\"auto\">Do you have anything more you want to share?</h3>\n<p dir=\"auto\"><em>No response</em></p>\n<h3 dir=\"auto\">MDN metadata</h3>\n\n<details>\n<summary>Page report details</summary>\n<ul dir=\"auto\">\n<li>Folder: <code class=\"notranslate\">en-us/web/api/touchevent/touches</code></li>\n<li>MDN URL: <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/TouchEvent/touches\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/TouchEvent/touches</a></li>\n<li>GitHub URL: <a href=\"https://github.com/mdn/content/blob/main/files/en-us/web/api/touchevent/touches/index.md\">https://github.com/mdn/content/blob/main/files/en-us/web/api/touchevent/touches/index.md</a></li>\n<li>Last commit: <a class=\"commit-link\" data-hovercard-type=\"commit\" data-hovercard-url=\"https://github.com/mdn/content/commit/7455f0c585ea29fa85ea09e11716b70f76241f5b/hovercard\" href=\"https://github.com/mdn/content/commit/7455f0c585ea29fa85ea09e11716b70f76241f5b\"><tt>7455f0c</tt></a></li>\n<li>Document last modified: 2022-09-11T19:35:30.000Z</li>\n</ul>\n</details>",
