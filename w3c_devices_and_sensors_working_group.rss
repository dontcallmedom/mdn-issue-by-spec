            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3 dir="auto">MDN URL</h3>
<p dir="auto"><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/DeviceMotionEvent/acceleration" rel="nofollow">https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/DeviceMotionEvent/acceleration</a></p>
<h3 dir="auto">What specific section or headline is this issue about?</h3>
<p dir="auto"><em>No response</em></p>
<h3 dir="auto">What information was incorrect, unhelpful, or incomplete?</h3>
<p dir="auto">It says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto">x<br>
Represents the acceleration upon the x axis which is the <strong>west to east axis</strong><br>
y<br>
Represents the acceleration upon the y axis which is the <strong>south to north axis</strong></p>
<p dir="auto">z<br>
Represents the acceleration upon the z axis which is the <strong>down to up axis</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p dir="auto">Now, the definitions of "west to east" and "south to north" axes are completely unambiguous (unless you are on one of the poles), and crystal clear. And it's <strong>definitely not true</strong> that <code class="notranslate">x</code> and <code class="notranslate">y</code> correspond to west to east and north to south.</p>
<p dir="auto">"Down to up" on its own would be potentially ambiguous, but given the other two are east to west and south to north, one can only reasonably assume that <strong>"up to down" is referring to the surface of the earth</strong>. And of course, that is <strong>also not true</strong>.</p>
<p dir="auto">By  that description, one would unambiguously understand (wrongly) that the coordinates are <strong>absolute and in no way influenced by the orientation of the device</strong>. One can only infer that the system has already done the necessary calculations behind the scene to compute those values (which by the way is only possible by using also the compass as well as the accelerometer; and also I think it would involve some heuristics, not entirely sure about that).</p>
<p dir="auto">I couldn't believe it but it is so crystal clear and unambiguously stated, that I assumed it had to be true. But of course my gut instinct was right ðŸ¤¦</p>
<h3 dir="auto">What did you expect to see?</h3>
<p dir="auto">From some quick experiments, I think the reality is:</p>
<p dir="auto">x: corresponds to the x axis of the html document (not sure if with the same sign or opposite)<br>
y: corresponds to the y axis of the html document (not sure if with the same sign or opposite)<br>
z: corresponds to the remaining perpendicular axis, so one that either points into the screen or out of the screen.</p>
<p dir="auto">Which of course makes way more sense ðŸ¤¦</p>
<p dir="auto">And this is true both for <code class="notranslate">acceleration</code> and <code class="notranslate">accelerationIncludingGravity</code></p>
<h3 dir="auto">Do you have any supporting links, references, or citations?</h3>
<p dir="auto"><em>No response</em></p>
<h3 dir="auto">Do you have anything more you want to share?</h3>

<p dir="auto">A number of docs related to device orientation</p>
<p dir="auto"><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events/Orientation_and_motion_data_explained" rel="nofollow">Orientation and motion data explained</a></p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Still marked as draft</li>
<li>Does not cover DeviceMotion frame.</li>
<li>Explains only the absolute frame, not the relative frame.</li>
</ul>

<ul dir="auto">
<li>
<p dir="auto">needs better linking to above doc.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/ondeviceorientationabsolute" rel="nofollow">Window.ondeviceorientationabsolute</a> - corresponding docs missing. Looks like this is absolute-only version of orientation relative to earth frame, based on compass.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/deviceorientation_event" rel="nofollow">Window.deviceorientation_event</a> and <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/ondeviceorientation" rel="nofollow">Window.ondeviceorientation</a></p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Marked experimental, but looks like the main API</li>
<li>Documented as relative to earth frame, but has absolute and relative value. Various docs indicate it is not standardised and some systems do relative, some absolute. Not clear what relative "means". So basically need to find out what relative means and what systems support what behaviour.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/orientation" rel="nofollow">Window.orientationchange</a> (also the event). This is the angle relative to the natural device orientation of the screen. So relative to the deviceorientation.</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Marked as deprecated, but not clear what should be used?</li>
<li>There is also <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Screen/onorientationchange" rel="nofollow">Screen.onorientationchange</a> that is also deprecated and FF only.</li>
</ul>
