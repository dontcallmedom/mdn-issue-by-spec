Need more information on its syntax and semantics.</p>\n<p dir=\"auto\">Very importantly, import assertions do not change the semantics of the module itselfâ€”it cannot affect how the module is interpreted, nor can it be used as part of the cache key. Virtually all existing toolings, except JSON modules themselves (<code class=\"notranslate\">assert { type: \"json\" }</code>), that try to extend import assertions are using them in a spec-incompliant way. (TBH, that to me means the proposal is designed poorly.) We need to call that out.</p>\n<p dir=\"auto\">We just need a new section under <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/import\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/import</a>, but with so many additions to JavaScript modules in the future, it may make sense to start a new reference chapter like \"modules\", parallel to the existing \"classes\" and \"functions\" chapters...</p>\n<h2 dir=\"auto\">Other supporting information</h2>\n<ul dir=\"auto\">\n<li>Spec draft: <a href=\"https://tc39.es/proposal-import-assertions/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://tc39.es/proposal-import-assertions/</a></li>\n<li>Proposal: <a href=\"https://github.com/tc39/proposal-import-assertions\">https://github.com/tc39/proposal-import-assertions</a></li>\n<li>This is a sibling proposal of <a href=\"https://github.com/tc39/proposal-json-modules\">JSON modules</a>, so we should probably mention that as well.</li>\n<li>Only after this proposal does <code class=\"notranslate\">import()</code> have a second parameter and therefore optional trailing comma. <code class=\"notranslate\">import(\"foo\",)</code> works in Chrome but is a syntax error in Safari/Firefox. We need to add this to BCD and the trailing commas page: <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Trailing_commas\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Trailing_commas</a></li>\n</ul>",

It will require readers to make a judgement about whether this could affect them, by testing or looking at release dates for the browsers.</p>\n<h2 dir=\"auto\">What did you expect to see?</h2>\n<p dir=\"auto\">Irrelevant information should be pruned from MDN after some time. Perhaps some special markup could be used when referring to a specific browser version, so that tools could be written to list information about browser releases too old to be relevant. Such cleanup happens to some extent in BCD, around irrelevant features removed from all browsers for more than 2 years, and also old flag data.</p>\n<h2 dir=\"auto\">Did you test this? If so, how?</h2>\n<p dir=\"auto\">Searching for \"Chrome \" + a number of any other browser followed by a number can find many examples like these.</p>",
