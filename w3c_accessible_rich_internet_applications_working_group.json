Many screen readers just announce \"menu\" instead of any of those values.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, developers regularly try to use aria-haspopup=\"dialog\" because of the frequent use of popup modal dialogs, and because of a multitude of articles on the internet recommending it. To have \"menu\" announced instead is confusing for blind screen reader users.</p>\n<p>To the best of my knowledge this defect applies to all mainstream screen readers except one, and there is no known likelihood of any of them taking these values on board in the foreseeable future.</p>\n<p>So I recommend that:<br>\na) you add a highly visible note to this MDN page to make clear that those other values are not supported by assistive technology and therefore should not be used<br>\nb) replace all the green markers in your chart by \"partial compliance only\" ones.</p>\n\n<details>\n<summary>MDN Content page report details</summary>\n<ul>\n<li>Folder: <code>en-us/web/api/element/ariahaspopup</code></li>\n<li>MDN URL: <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/ariaHasPopup\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/ariaHasPopup</a></li>\n<li>GitHub URL: <a href=\"https://github.com/mdn/content/blob/main/files/en-us/web/api/element/ariahaspopup/index.html\">https://github.com/mdn/content/blob/main/files/en-us/web/api/element/ariahaspopup/index.html</a></li>\n<li>Last commit: <a class=\"commit-link\" data-hovercard-type=\"commit\" data-hovercard-url=\"https://github.com/mdn/content/commit/8455a83fd1ba95f5e8cb2fadebab82cd77111579/hovercard\" href=\"https://github.com/mdn/content/commit/8455a83fd1ba95f5e8cb2fadebab82cd77111579\"><tt>8455a83</tt></a></li>\n<li>Document last modified: 2021-06-12T21:26:13.000Z</li>\n</ul>\n</details>",
