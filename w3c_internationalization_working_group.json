What tool am I suppose to use ?  What would be the format of the file ?</p>\n<p dir=\"auto\">\"Does it address critical needs in the web industry?\"<br>\nProbably not but this feature existed in Adobe Flash (the ability to package multiple assets, easy to target, inside a single file) and I really miss it. The idea I could do it again soon with ImageDecoder &amp; ImageTrackList makes me very happy. Please show us a step by step example to create such images .</p>\n<p dir=\"auto\">MDN URL: <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/</a><br>\nMDN URL: <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/TextEncoder\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/TextEncoder</a></p>",
