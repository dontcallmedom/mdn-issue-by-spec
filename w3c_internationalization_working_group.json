It is unlikely that long text will exceed s.length * 2 bytes in length. Thus, a more optimistic approach might be to allocate s.length * 2 + 5 bytes, and perform reallocation in the rare circumstance that the optimistic prediction was wrong.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p dir=\"auto\">It may be true if the <code class=\"notranslate\">s</code> is written in European languages, but in most case, to encode CJK strings needs <code class=\"notranslate\">s.length * 3</code> bytes because most of CJK characters are represented as three bytes per a character in UTF-8. So, it causes too frequent reallocation if <code class=\"notranslate\">s</code> contains a string in CJK languages (which are used by about 20% people in the world).</p>\n<h3 dir=\"auto\">What did you expect to see?</h3>\n<p dir=\"auto\">In the first place, should be such a section in a reference page? (I think it is preferred in guide pages).</p>\n<p dir=\"auto\">If it is written in the page, it should just say that the max length needed for buffer is <code class=\"notranslate\">s.length * 3</code>.</p>\n<h3 dir=\"auto\">Do you have any supporting links, references, or citations?</h3>\n<p dir=\"auto\"><em>No response</em></p>\n<h3 dir=\"auto\">Do you have anything more you want to share?</h3>\n<p dir=\"auto\"><em>No response</em></p>",

What tool am I suppose to use ?  What would be the format of the file ?</p>\n<p dir=\"auto\">\"Does it address critical needs in the web industry?\"<br>\nProbably not but this feature existed in Adobe Flash (the ability to package multiple assets, easy to target, inside a single file) and I really miss it. The idea I could do it again soon with ImageDecoder &amp; ImageTrackList makes me very happy. Please show us a step by step example to create such images .</p>\n<p dir=\"auto\">MDN URL: <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/</a><br>\nMDN URL: <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/TextEncoder\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/TextEncoder</a></p>",
