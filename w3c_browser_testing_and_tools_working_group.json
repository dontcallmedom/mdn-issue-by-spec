While the <a href=\"https://w3c.github.io/webdriver/\" rel=\"nofollow\">WebDriver specification</a> itself is targeted to those who actually implement the browser specific drivers (geckodriver, chromedriver, safaridriver, edgedriver,...), the documentation on MDN should give a resource for clients using these drivers. So topics like which commands are available, what is their HTTP end-point, which HTTP method and payload do they need, and what's the response. But all this should be moved to a new issue for further discussion.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p dir=\"auto\">MDN URL: <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/WebDriver\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/WebDriver</a></p>\n<p dir=\"auto\"><em>Originally posted by <a class=\"user-mention notranslate\" data-hovercard-type=\"user\" data-hovercard-url=\"/users/whimboo/hovercard\" data-octo-click=\"hovercard-link-click\" data-octo-dimensions=\"link_type:self\" href=\"https://github.com/whimboo\">@whimboo</a> in <a class=\"issue-link js-issue-link\" data-error-text=\"Failed to load title\" data-id=\"862956455\" data-permission-text=\"Title is private\" data-url=\"https://github.com/mdn/content/issues/4315\" data-hovercard-type=\"issue\" data-hovercard-url=\"/mdn/content/issues/4315/hovercard?comment_id=832492962&amp;comment_type=issue_comment\" href=\"https://github.com/mdn/content/issues/4315#issuecomment-832492962\">#4315 (comment)</a></em></p>",
