            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3 dir="auto">MDN URL</h3>
<p dir="auto"><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/TextEncoder/encodeInto" rel="nofollow">https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/TextEncoder/encodeInto</a></p>
<h3 dir="auto">What specific section or headline is this issue about?</h3>
<p dir="auto">Buffer sizing</p>
<h3 dir="auto">What information was incorrect, unhelpful, or incomplete?</h3>
<p dir="auto">The section says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto">Note that the s.length * 3 is rare because the string would have to be packed with some of the few characters that expand into 3 bytes. It is unlikely that long text will exceed s.length * 2 bytes in length. Thus, a more optimistic approach might be to allocate s.length * 2 + 5 bytes, and perform reallocation in the rare circumstance that the optimistic prediction was wrong.</p>
</blockquote>
<p dir="auto">It may be true if the <code class="notranslate">s</code> is written in European languages, but in most case, to encode CJK strings needs <code class="notranslate">s.length * 3</code> bytes because most of CJK characters are represented as three bytes per a character in UTF-8. So, it causes too frequent reallocation if <code class="notranslate">s</code> contains a string in CJK languages (which are used by about 20% people in the world).</p>
<h3 dir="auto">What did you expect to see?</h3>
<p dir="auto">In the first place, should be such a section in a reference page? (I think it is preferred in guide pages).</p>
<p dir="auto">If it is written in the page, it should just say that the max length needed for buffer is <code class="notranslate">s.length * 3</code>.</p>
<h3 dir="auto">Do you have any supporting links, references, or citations?</h3>
<p dir="auto"><em>No response</em></p>
<h3 dir="auto">Do you have anything more you want to share?</h3>
<p dir="auto"><em>No response</em></p>]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://github.com/mdn/content/issues/12791</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 dir="auto">What is the new suggestion?</h2>
<p dir="auto">Webcodecs introduce ImageDecoder and ImageDecoder come with ImageTrackList.<br>
It sounds like a nice feature but I can't figure out how to provide an image file containing multiple tracks...<br>
I even never heard about tracks inside an image and google doesn't help me at all with that.</p>
<p dir="auto">ImageTrackList exists so I'm sure it's doable but how to package multiple tracks inside a single image file ?</p>
<h2 dir="auto">Why is it important or useful?</h2>
<p dir="auto">I think it would be a great way to organised assets compared to a spritesheet but I have no idea how to create the multi-tracks-image.  What tool am I suppose to use ?  What would be the format of the file ?</p>
<p dir="auto">"Does it address critical needs in the web industry?"<br>
Probably not but this feature existed in Adobe Flash (the ability to package multiple assets, easy to target, inside a single file) and I really miss it. The idea I could do it again soon with ImageDecoder &amp; ImageTrackList makes me very happy. Please show us a step by step example to create such images .</p>
