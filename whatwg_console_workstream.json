In addition to that, in my testing, it appears that Chrome ignores the formatting and prints out the number with %i, %d, and %f.</p>\n<h4 dir=\"auto\">Specific section or headline?</h4>\n<p dir=\"auto\">Under \"Using string substitutions\" and under \"Browser Compatibility\"</p>\n<h4 dir=\"auto\">What did you expect to see?</h4>\n<p dir=\"auto\">I expected to see either a description, or a link to a page with a description, on how one may use the number formatting. It isn't quite straightforward from what is written here. In addition to this, I expected to see Browser Compatibility make some mention that the formatting is ignored on Chrome.</p>\n<h4 dir=\"auto\">Did you test this? If so, how?</h4>\n<p dir=\"auto\">I tested out number formatting, and (at least on chrome) the logging (log, info, warn, and error) appears to ignore number formatting. The \"Browser Compatibility\" section has no mention of this substitution string formatting issue.</p>\n\n<details>\n<summary>MDN Content page report details</summary>\n<ul dir=\"auto\">\n<li>Folder: <code class=\"notranslate\">en-us/web/api/console</code></li>\n<li>MDN URL: <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Console\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Console</a></li>\n<li>GitHub URL: <a href=\"https://github.com/mdn/content/blob/main/files/en-us/web/api/console/index.html\">https://github.com/mdn/content/blob/main/files/en-us/web/api/console/index.html</a></li>\n<li>Last commit: <a class=\"commit-link\" data-hovercard-type=\"commit\" data-hovercard-url=\"https://github.com/mdn/content/commit/cbca1200cf311812cd61fab50a4d0ff67f759fd1/hovercard\" href=\"https://github.com/mdn/content/commit/cbca1200cf311812cd61fab50a4d0ff67f759fd1\"><tt>cbca120</tt></a></li>\n<li>Document last modified: 2021-06-28T01:25:18.000Z</li>\n</ul>\n</details>",
